# live-retro

An agile retrospective productivity app created during the July 2016 9Digital hackathon by [@mrm007](https://github.com/mrm007) and [@madou](https://github.com/madou).

Master controls the state of the retrospective, participants make submissions, vote on the ones they care about the most, and then discuss.
